          <p>"Selflessness is what has brought me the most happiness."
            Selflessness is the key to inner happiness;   Selfishness is the key to your own destruction.
            In this huge and diversified world there are many different kinds of people possessing different natures which have two broad categories: selfless nature and selfish nature. There are a lot of people who are more selfish rather than selfless. Here by selfish it means that just thinking about your own good and not caring about others feelings. These kinds of people are self-centered and self-absorbed. On the contrary the people who are real friendly, helpful, kind and who always smile brightly tend to be more selfless than selfish. If a person wants inner satisfaction and inner happiness, he can acquire it by being kind, selfless and forgivable.
